#Notes:
#   1) Assumes action by each line follows strict time order
#   2) Out of time order causes the next line being executed immediately after the previous one
#   3) First line will be executed immediately(assumed it's NOW), 
#      and the rest will be executed by the time difference.
#   4) For amend, only quantity or price change is valid. Put value 0 if it is not changed.
#   5) MarketReplay provides a timeFactor parameter which will either accelerate(positive value)
#      or decelerate(negative value) the replay speed. 
#      e.g 4 means 4 times faster and -4 means 4 times slower
